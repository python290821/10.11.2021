'''
create a Book class. now, create an instance of your
favorite book with the following data fields:
title, author, genre, year_of_publish, no_of_pages
 (1) create the instance data using dictionary [for example:
      myBook.__dict__[‘year_of_publish’] = 1961]
 (2) create the instance data using dot
     [for example: myBook.title = ‘catch 22’]
 (3) create a method which creates a new books instance
     and data (see the create_Person method we did in lesson)
